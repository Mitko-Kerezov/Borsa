An electronic market for textbooks. It was the first project I ever worked on in 2010.

The project needs a database which is provided in the database.sql file.
Access to the database can be modified in the config.php file.

The aim of the project is easier communication between students who wish to sell their old textbooks.

Since this is my first project the code is pretty messed up.
